### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a python backend developer with 12+ years of experience in construction and mechanical engineering. Senior engineer in mechanical engineering, but just junior in software engineering. Now Iâ€™m doing my best to fix it. Have a passion for developing web services for the construction and real estate industry.
