### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a python backend developer with 12+ years of experience in construction and [MEP engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical,_electrical,_and_plumbing). Senior engineer in MEP engineering, but just junior in software engineering. Now Iâ€™m doing my best to fix it. Have a passion for developing web services for the construction and real estate industry.
